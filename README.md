# Metis\_Module4\_Classification\_Project

## Descripton

This is the fourth project of Metis Data Science Bootcamp. We're going to build classification models to make useful prediction. I chose to build a classification model to predict which pitch type a pitcher will pitch under certain game situations. Max Scherzer who is a 14-year MLB pitcher and an eight-time MLB All-Star and has three-time Cy Young Awards, 3,000 strikeouts, two no-hitter games, and a World Series championship will be the example pitcher I am going to predict.
